    "Final Abstract": "I spent this past summer in my hometown of Durham, North Carolina volunteering at the Museum of Durham History during which I learned more about Durham than I had in over a decade of living there. While at the museum, I conducted research and wrote content for the “Tell Us What We Left Out” exhibit, took photos and videos to market another current exhibit, and interacted with museum visitors on a regular basis. The “Tell Us What We Left Out” exhibit features sticky notes which visitors use to submit topics they want to learn more about, research is done on the topic, then the write-up and laminated note are displayed side-by-side in the exhibit space. I used the research and writing skills acquired through my coursework in the humanities and discovered firsthand the power of having museum visitors drive the narrative and content of their local museum.",

    "Final Abstract": "Over the summer, I worked in Burma with filmmakers I met while studying abroad in Prague (including one Burmese) to capture the compelling narratives of Burmese female construction workers who were physically developing what has been until recently one of the most isolated nations in the world. As Director and Executive Producer of The Construct; Female Laborers and the Fight for Equality, I handled fundraising, daily logistics, and interviewing subjects. This difficult but extremely rewarding project brought together theories and skills from my two majors, CAMS and Political Science. I learned on the ground how to communicate, coordinate, and ultimately get the shots we needed—and also learned the many difficulties of documenting (and gaining access to) other people’s lives. I look forward to continuing to work with international filmmakers on documentary films that tell the stories of women and girls around the world.",

KitchenFilm is an independent company, whose founder, Emanuela Piovano, has been directing and producing films since the 1980s in her hometown Torino, the birthplace of Italian cinema. My duties as an intern were always plentiful and at KitchenFilm they entrusted me with a lot of responsibilities, such as translating into English documents or interviews conducted in Italian, cataloging books into a filer system, analyzing films they have produced, and exploring effective marketing strategies for their film. What is special about this company is its dedication to making women the central focus of their work. The world of cinema is a male oriented field, thus they have made it their mission to promote women in the film industry This was an amazing experience which I highly recommend!",

Norton & Company, the largest and oldest independent and employee-owned publishing company in the U.S. I had the privilege to work full-time with the Norton Anthologies as an editorial assistant on the College Department Literature Team. Immersing myself in the details of anthology publication, from editing tables of contents and footnotes to handling permissions and copyright, I learned about the diverse tasks that go into compiling anthologies, and ultimately about why anthologies tend to break the general rules of college textbook publishing. In this presentation, I hope to shed some light on this very specific niche of the publishing industry through my experiences with not only the immediate internship tasks, but also with the networking and intern collaboration that accompanied them.",

    "Final Abstract": "What relevance could medieval religion possibly have in the realm of modern tourism? Quite a lot, apparently, as I learned last summer during my internship as a student guide at Saint Sauveur Cathedral in Aix-en-Provence, France. As I gave guided tours of the fantastically preserved twelfth-century cloister and wrote a research paper on the fifth-century baptistery, which was constructed on the remains of a Roman forum, I was struck by the contrast between the ancient religious beliefs still practiced by many, which inspired the construction of these monuments, and the tourism industry, which views such buildings primarily as cultural collateral. Through my research and hands-on experience, I eventually came to see this juxtaposition as part of the continuation of a broader ideological paradigm that blurs the boundaries between the sacred and the profane.",

I had the opportunity to give the news on air every day, in French, and during the month of July, I started a daily segment in English dedicated to less-touristy things to do in Paris for foreigners called “An American In Paris.” I was intrigued, and sometimes surprised, by the cultural differences apparent in France, both at work and during daily life in the city. This internship allowed me to experiment with a form of media that was new to me, and helped to strengthen my French skills. It also let me engage with Paris in a rewarding and engaging way, giving me a new perspective on the city.",

My internship, which was sponsored by Wellesley’s English Department, focused on motion picture development and pre-production-- everything that needs to happen on a film project before the camera starts rolling, from revising the script to casting and preparing for shooting. As a Cinema and Media Studies major with a background in on-set film production, participating in this earlier stage of the filmmaking process was eye-opening and gave me a more well-rounded view of the independent film industry. It showed me firsthand that it is possible to change the film industry from within to improve diverse representation, and I hope that by coming to my presentation the Wellesley community can better understand the development and production processes of filmmaking and their impact on (as well as the impact of) society.",

The interns came from a variety of academic backgrounds and differing levels of experience with the Davis. Through our positions in various departments, we completed a diverse range of projects that included providing content for a new interactive app, planning upcoming exhibitions for the reinstallation, developing educational programming, helping to build the revamped Davis website, and much more. Weekly visits to New England museums and a week-long trip to New York City provided the interns with the chance to experience a variety of museum models and to develop the skills to critically assess their museum experiences. Audience engagement, whether through accessible labels or the use of technology, acted as a major recurring theme during the internship. Through the internship, we gathered around a common interest of making museums educational spaces where communities can come together and have fun in a welcoming environment.",

    "Final Abstract": "What makes a book “good”?  Are these the same qualities that make a book commercially successful? This summer I worked at Kneerim & Williams Literary Agency in Boston. Through this experience, I explored a lesser-seen part of the publishing industry, one in which agents curate the pool of writing from which publishers choose, shaping and determining what kinds of content the general public will ultimately read. Agents must possess a refined but open palate, a strong awareness of the modern market, and a keen, perhaps even instinctual, sense of taste. Navigating an interesting boundary between upmarket (works of literary and scholarly merit) and trade (works with commercial appeal), agents must evaluate books not only as editors, but also as readers, lawyers, marketers and salespeople. In my presentation I hope to paint a portrait of this unusual and multifaceted side of publishing. ",

As an art history major, I was able to appreciate the time, effort, and skill that go into ensuring art's longevity.  ",

    "Final Abstract": "I hiked the French route of Camino de Santiago this summer. Hiking 800 km from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago was a physically, mentally challenging experience. However, it was an opportunity to interact with people regardless their ages, professions, and ethnicities. Standards used to classify people in society meant nothing on the road. What matters the most to pilgrims -- people who are on the road -- was reaching Santiago. Although pilgrims had just met a new group of people on the road, they supported and encouraged each other merely because they share one common goal arriving in Santiago. People on the Camino de Santiago are somewhat similar to people in Wellesley; both are diverse groups of people endeavoring to achieve their own goals. I hope my presentation encourages students to create a supportive environment in Wellesley where students are pilgrims who metaphorically hike to their own Santiago.",

Our presentation Tangier Then and Now takes a photographic look at the city of Tangier and documents significant changes in its urban landscape from early 20th century to the present. Additionally, we helped coordinate a creative arts and media festival, Youmein, and volunteered at a day camp to engage local children through art, music, and theatre. Our internship provided us with a great opportunity to deepen our understanding and appreciation of Moroccan and North African cultures. It also helped us contextualize previous readings and reconnect with our Wellesley courses and experiences. We hope attendees will learn through our experiences the importance of seeking out new cultures and the enrichment they bring to both our academic work and personal development.",

While this conference was interdisciplinary, I went with the explicit goal of learning more about transgender performance. Being able to watch and interact with other transgender performing artists was an experience that perfectly captured the intersection between my Theater Studies major, my Women's and Gender Studies major, and my personal experiences. In addition to the performance-related parts of the conference, I learned about recent theoretical explorations of transgender embodiments and methodologies. This conference provided me with critical tools to help me explore and contextualize my experiences as a transgender theater artist. I hope that I can share my learnings from this conference and provide “best practices” recommendations for ways that Wellesley and Boston theaters can work more closely and more sensitively with transgender theater artists.",

    "Final Abstract": "Often, it isn’t until one is removed from one’s present environment that one recognizes the value of a unique experience. As we discovered ourselves, Wellesley students begin to appreciate the value of their unique college tenure once away from campus. This past year, we built upon what we learned at Wellesley by immersing ourselves in the different cultures of England, Italy, and France. In doing so, we took away a common theme of open-mindedness. Our presentation will focus on the Wellesley experience and how that prepared us for our time abroad, shaped our lives once there, and how that experience impacted our return to campus. Having an open mind enriches one’s experience in a foreign environment, permitting oneself to immerse in the lightness of discovery and learning. We learned to value our short time abroad and hope that our experiences encourage you to value your time and relationships at Wellesley.",

    "Final Abstract": "Through comics (bande dessinée), a genre beloved by the French, female authors have questioned and resisted the idea of a singular feminine experience and the stereotype of the French woman. While studying abroad in Aix, I examined how female graphic novelists (Marjane Satrapi, Gally, Chloé Cruchaudet) in particular have expanded the mainstream conception of what it means to be a woman in France, encouraging understanding and tolerance. This study led me to discover comics as my own medium of personal expression. Both visual and literary, comics offered me the opportunity to communicate at a time when I struggled to articulate myself emotionally and intellectually and through my cartoon blog I was able to connect to my Wellesley community while abroad. I hope to leave the audience with a more complex understanding of comics’ potential to relay an emotional, social, or political reality to the reader. ",

    "Final Abstract": "Every day of my summer internship in MoMA’s Collection Management and Exhibition Registration department was an exercise in professional development. My main objective was to understand the department’s role in the museum, and to gain experience working with registrars. Despite being an “invisible” department to outsiders, it is crucial to the operation of any museum. By speaking with co-workers, I was able to gain a greater understanding of art world politics and build on my previous experience working for the Davis registrars. I know my summer internship will be useful in my remaining time at Wellesley, and I am building my schedule to include courses and activities that will help me become a registrar in the future. Through my presentation, I hope that people will learn about the diversity of careers in the art world, and understand the importance of museum registrars to the visibility and stewardship of art worldwide.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer we interned at the Lobkowicz Palace, a museum at the edge of Prague’s palace complex and privately owned by the Lobkowicz family. The prominent family has been known in the Czech Republic for over 700 years for their music patronage and art collecting.  In the 20th century they were forced into exile by the Nazis, and then their property was confiscated by the Communist regime after WW II. Since the restitution of the several castles and collections in the 1990s, the Lobkowicz treasures have become a cultural fixture in the Czech Republic. Yet, visitors to the Lobkowicz Palace see only a small part of all that the dedicated staff do to make the vast collection publicly accessible. Departments collaborate behind the scenes to preserve artworks, fundraise for exhibitions, and breathe life into the Collections. We worked with the small staff to pursue projects varying from creating a Lobkowicz coloring book to documenting objects for a pictorial inventory. In doing so, we explored a museum’s unseen labor in bringing art to life today and for generations to come.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer, I interned at City Weekend, a lifestyle and entertainment magazine geared towards expats living in Beijing, China. As an intern, I was given free range to roam about China’s capital looking for story ideas and writing about the places and people I encountered. What I was not expecting to find on these jaunts, however, was a new level of self-confidence and comfort within my own skin. In a city where the average woman is 5’3 and Chinese, I quickly learned to accept my foreignness and how to proudly hold my head high. During this period of personal emotional, intellectual, and physical growth, the magazine I worked at similarly underwent a modern restructuring of its own. In a time of change and uncertainty, I learned the value of staying true to myself half a world away from home.",

I listened as Jean Kilbourne famously pointed out in her documentary series \"Killing Us Softly\" that \"Ads sell more than products ... To a great extent they tell us who we are and who we should be,\" and I critiqued the ads in my magazines. Yet, when I spent this past summer interning at TBWA\\Worldwide, a leading advertising agency in New York City, I was struck by how different advertising was in the workplace the way agencies struggle with their responsibility and power in culture, the complications that come from working with clients, and the role that the individual consumer plays in advertising. This presentation will discuss the little-known sides of advertising, the challenges agencies must face, and the way each and every one of us can shape our culture.",

The most interesting for me was really learning about the environment of feminism in Japan—often called a man’s country. ",

Through my experiences with CSAJ I developed a deeper understanding of how the theoretical and academic call for intersectionality travels to advocacy institutions, the work they do, and the workplaces they create. CSAJ’s work is grounded in an approach of survivor centered economic advocacy, which places emphasis on the survivor’s lived experiences and the links between poverty and domestic violence. The scholarly orientation at the founding of CSAJ and its translation to their advocacy work and office environment provides an interesting case study for how the self-aware, intersectional community found at Wellesley can be created beyond “the bubble”. ",

Interns at Walker supported staff members by helping coordinate classroom activities, and used Therapeutic Crisis Intervention to de-escalate children. The Riverside intern observed a range of group therapies and assisted coordinators with the planning and leading of the therapeutic sessions. The interns learned how to apply psychological theories and treatment approaches for children and adults. These internships demonstrated the significance of abnormal and developmental psychology in working with a variety of populations, as well as highlighting possible career fields. We hope that the presentation will shed light on the mental health treatments that are available in our community, and reduce stigma associated with accessing those treatments.",

    "Final Abstract": "When you think of Washington, D.C., what do you think of? Do you think of the Capitol and Senate? Do you think of the Supreme Court and the White House? Of course. But do you also think about the non-profits, the museums, and the social work sector? Probably not. However, these underrepresented sectors are integral parts of Washington. Together, we worked on social research, social justice, and museum work in Washington. Eunbyul conducted research on trans youth and trans homicides in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Meredith handled financial development for The DC Center for the LGBT Community. Ananya provided direct service with survivors of domestic violence at DC SAFE as they navigated the criminal and civil justice systems. Kiera worked for the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian developing curriculum for children. Aggie worked on a trauma-related insomnia research team at Howard University Hospital.",

    "Final Abstract": "As a Nepali-American Seattleite, I love hiking, backpacking and experiencing mountainous bliss. My WellesleyServes! internship at The Wilderness Inner-city Leadership Development (WILD) program in Seattle’s Chinatown transformed my perspective of the outdoors. My summer experience has shown me the impact the outdoors can have on empowering youth of color and their communities. WILD is a one-of-a-kind environmental justice and outdoor leadership program mentored by people of color for predominately low-income, Asian Pacific Islander (API) immigrant and refugee youth. Typically, youth outdoor programs often result in youths’ isolation of the two places, the outdoors and home/community. I challenged the traditional framework by teaching my “Exploring a Sense of Place” curriculum and mapping activities (inspired by Marcy Thomas’ writing course). Throughout the summer, I supported the youth on their unique journeys to mentally and emotionally connect their experiences as environmental stewards in Washington’s outdoors and youth leaders in their local Chinatown community.",

    "Final Abstract": "Aldea Yanapay was founded twelve years ago to address Perú’s stringent education system and widespread domestic violence. By providing a “conscient education” (educación consciente) based on the values of love, tolerance, and respect, Aldea presents una otra forma de vivir, or a different way of life, one that directly combats the violence children encounter at home and in school. Originally, I imagined teaching at Aldea Yanapay would involve me standing at the front of a classroom, delivering curriculum to students seated in desks. However, because Yanapay promotes an emotional and spiritual focus and the development of the whole person, its unique brand of conscient education is achieved through art, dance, music, and cultural exchange. As a volunteer at the organization, I witnessed how love can transform a community, and learned how to empower youth through conscient education to help them reach their full life potential and affect sustainable grassroots change.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer we engaged in a variety of classroom settings--from working with low income preschoolers and adults in Berkeley, California, to developing and implementing curricula for students in Kampala, Uganda. Despite our geographic divide, each of us gained a contextual understanding of the role of education in a national framework. We worked with students who were only months old, adults returning to school or starting for the first time, and everyone in between. Along the way, we came to understand the ways in which education can serve as an equalizer and function as a stark indicator of difference. While we encountered an array of socioeconomic disparities this summer, we also recognized the ways in which our sites reproduced structural inequalities. This presentation will highlight the similarities and differences between public and private funding, teaching in classrooms versus one-on-one instruction, and our experiences in the United States and abroad.",

    "Final Abstract": "During my summer internship at Health Care For All, a Boston-based health advocacy organization for improving healthcare in Massachusetts, I created a story bank by conducting phone interviews with residents throughout the state. Historically stories about daily hardships have been used to help pass state laws to improve quality and access to healthcare. For instance, a story about the woman in Cambridge who rationed her asthma medication because her co-pay was not affordable is more powerful to help ?pass a law to decrease prescription drug costs than only quantitative data about the costs. I learned that public policy in addition to medicine helps individuals achieve better health through advocacy efforts from the grassroots level to the State House. ",

The two main projects I helped with centered on gender equality, one each in the private and public sectors. I supported UNDP’s collaborative project with INAMU (the National Institute of Women) in their Gender Equality Seal program, which aims to promote gender equality and women’s economic empowerment in the workplace. The second project’s goal is helping the 20 women in Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly work together and pass two law reforms and an amendment related to gender equality and women’s rights. Through my research and the events I attended with the public sector I learned of the need for a gender mainstreaming approach in development projects, all the while witnessing the free spirited ‘Pura Vida’ culture of the Ticos very much present within the UN-House in San José.",

Question 4, on the ballot in November, will gradually raise Maine's minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by 2020, and the subminimum wage for tipped workers from $3.75 to $12 by 2024. We hear a lot about the wage gap, and in Maine, the majority of minimum wage workers are women. My experience this summer exposed me to the breadth of people in dire need of a wage increase. In particular, through organizing in a state where manufacturing jobs are rapidly declining and the service industry is the largest employer, I realized the need for a higher minimum wage for an economically viable future, and one in which women can survive and prosper.",

My decision to work in Istanbul wastwofold (1) I wanted to further enrich my study abroad experience when I conducted research atthe AlZaatrirefugee camp in Amman, Jordan? and (2) I wanted to apply the research Iconducted and the solutions I found during the Albright Institute on the challenges of providingquality education to refugees.My greatest takeaway from this experience was the humanitarian community’s lack offoresight in its identification of and aid to vulnerable refugee groups. Though women, children,survivors of violence, people with physical or mental disabilities, and ethnic minoritiestraditionally constitute the bulk of vulnerable persons during wars and crises, the lack ofhumanitarian attention to single men ages 1835in this crisis has proven detrimental for theirintegration and empowerment in their host countries.This presentation will seek to unravel the hidden tensions in the Syrian refugee crisis, thehumanitarian and international community’s response, or lack thereof, to these tensions, and myproject at Small Projects Istanbul that served to empower a lost generation.",

This summer we worked at Operation ASHA, an NGO based in New Delhi that works to end this infectious disease that is curable with antibiotics. We learned about their pipeline approach to delivering the government-sponsored medicines to the doorsteps of their patients in urban vs. rural settings. Furthermore, we had the opportunity to interview the only XXDR-TB or extremely drug-resistant TB patient OpASHA has completely cured; although TB free her family has no source of income for sustaining themselves in the future. Towards the end, we worked on redesigning their website by editing and restructuring content and adding graphics, videos, and patient stories. We hope to take this experience forward to promote TB awareness at Wellesley this year. By attending our presentation, we hope you learn how socioeconomic status can affect public health.",

    "Final Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder affects approximately 1% of the world population and is the fastest-growing developmental disability in the U.S. Patients with ASD display a range of behavioral symptoms, including hyperaggression. Aggression is not unique to humans; mice also display this innate social behavior. However, the precise neural circuits controlling aggression are not yet fully defined. My summer research in the Feng lab at MIT utilized the genetic approach of a mouse model with a mutated form of PTCHD1, a gene that has been associated with ASD and hyperaggression, to gain insight into aggression circuitry. I will discuss our behavioral experiments, which tested the response of mice to intruder mice, and our results that show inhibitory circuitry is mediating aggression in PTCHD1 mice. This experience furthered my interest in pursuing neurobiology research after Wellesley, while reminding me that the critical thinking skills Wellesley emphasizes are fundamental to the success of research. ",

I worked individually with students in classrooms on their tasks, built interpersonal relationships with the residents, and facilitated daily activities at the center. As a student intern, I shamelessly asked for help, acknowledged and overcame the language barrier (especially improving my Spanish) and gained confidence in my pursuit of the empowerment of marginalized communities. But more importantly, the experience taught me that in every wheelchair is a mother, a jewelry-maker, or a former French professor, each with his/her own story. I learned to differentiate ignorance from discrimination and to be a friend before being a worker. The compassionate embrace of the community and the rewards of genuine interactions truly gifted me an unforgettable summer.",

The effects of malnutrition have devastated the country’s indigenous population which has endured relentless persecution and crippling poverty. This summer, I interned with Mayan Families, a non-profit organization that seeks to empower the indigenous Mayan communities. Through collaboration, I helped implement various programs to provide nutritious meals, vitamins and medical resources for chronically malnourished children and their families. Working with the families gave me a deeper understanding of the challenges of dealing with malnutrition when coupled with a lack of access to economic security, education and basic needs like water and shelter. My summer experience was invaluable as it inspired me to explore how I can mitigate the health disparities facing indigenous communities and contemplate my future goals in global health. ",

    "Final Abstract": "Noted as one of the most beautiful islands in the world, Palawan has become a hot tourist destination. Many, however, are unaware that local Palaweños suffer from serious health problems including high rates of maternal death, teenage pregnancy and HIV infection. This summer, I interned at Roots of Health (ROH), a NGO, committed to empowering women by providing free clinical services and sexual education on the island. I learned how the intersection of culture, religion and politics contributed to the island’s health landscape and what is being done to transform old attitudes and behaviors. Concepts that I have learned in the classroom became lived experiences. For instance, I witnessed the tensions between the indigenous health system and biomedicine, and the creativity that accompanies improvised medicine. I will share experiences and stories from my interactions, providing a glimpse into their resiliency, hope and spirit as they look toward a brighter future.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer I explored how I could use my interest in Computer Science to solve social problems at home in Kenya. Throughout the process of developing an app to improve the accessibility of healthcare, I uncovered the intersections of poverty and healthcare problems. In most of the rural neighborhoods outside the major cities, there were establishments with physicians practing without standard or credible oversight. At these establishments there were long lines of patitents without other options waiting to be treated. I learned that many of these physicians were apprehensive about introducing our app at their practices, likely due to fear of exposure of their unsafe practices. This is only one of the many challenges we encountered which simultaneously demosntrated the great need for our app, which would help every patient locate and access credible health facilities near them. I have only begun to uncover the positive impact technology can make, and I am positive that a lot more can be done at home. I am eager to continue learning the difference I can make utilizing technology. ",

    "Final Abstract": "Over the course of this summer, I conducted microbiology research at the Universidad Católica de Córdoba (UCC) in Córdoba, Argentina. I investigated the antimicrobial resistance of salmonella on fresh pork sausage from the province of Córdoba, Argentina. Antimicrobial resistance can happen anywhere in the production chain. This is extremely important to public health because there are no regulations in the pig and pork production chain in Argentina. This experience was significant because I learned how much science intertwines with politics when thinking about public health policies, especially in developing countries. I was fortunate to be under the mentorship of Dr. Juan Pablo Vico and other faculty of UCC. Their genuine interest in helping me definitely reminded me of the faculty here at Wellesley. Finally, I hope my presentation shows my audience what it is to conduct scientific research abroad and the WHO concept of One Health. ",

The recently released standards must now be evaluated for feasibility and acceptability in the many settings to which they apply. This presentation will explore the experience of beginning the first INTERGROWTH-21st implementation study, which will be taking place for the next two years at Jacaranda Health, a maternal healthcare clinic outside of Nairobi, Kenya. This Gates Grand Challenges study is being conducted in partnership with the Harvard Public School of Health’s Maternal Health Task Force; the presentation will therefore touch upon inter-institutional communications and planning. The immersive experience made possible by the Albright Institute provided exposure to a new culture, an understanding of low-cost high-quality maternal healthcare, and general difficulties in much needed but rare implementation studies.",

These patients were on anti-retroviral therapy which, while it has transformed HIV from fatal disease into a manageable chronic illness, is not a cure. Today I will discuss how this study used vaccine response to measure immune strength and how learning more about HIVs effect on the immune system can help the search for a cure. I’ll also talk about my experience adapting the scientific method Wellesley has taught me to a study built around a vulnerable population, in which it was impossible to control for everything.

However, a hospital’s women’s department is more than maternity, and in reality may address aspects of women’s health from menstruation, menopause, endometriosis and mental health. Over the summer, I studied women’s health through a biological lens at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, United Kingdom. Through a combined experience in clinical observation and data analysis, I explored what it means to “be a woman,” and how our bodies operate at a personal baseline unique to us all. In this context, I came to a greater understanding of pregnancy and women’s health issues. For any woman, the state of “normal” is subjective, and in health care specifically I have learned that it is the culmination of inherent features and life events that make us each a little different.",

    "Final Abstract": "Understanding how a region’s cultural and religious practices impact the quality of care provided is essential to the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Last winter, I traveled to Doha, Qatar for four months to work in Labor & Delivery and Trauma as a volunteer Remote EMT. This transformative experience highlighted stark cultural differences in how the Qatari healthcare system approaches the care of female patients as compared to my observations of women’s healthcare within the United States. These variations are widespread and include delivery room visitation, female/male patient segregation, genital mutilation, child marriage, domestic abuse, sacrifice of quality for modesty, family dynamics, and religious approaches to grief counseling and important medical decisions. Developing a sensitivity to and knowledge of the history of these cultural nuances can result in more informed medical care and patient advocacy to these populations.Tags (didn't work above) Women, Health, Human Rights",

Through my summer internship, I realized how dental care in America is truly a privilege for those who can afford it. The systemic and persistent barriers that the underserved populations in our society face are immense. Although one might argue that state insured Medicaid programs have allowed low-income adults to have dental coverage, it is worth noting that dental access due to provider shortage, limited providers participating in Medicaid, and psycho-social determinants of health all impose significant barriers and exacerbate care-seeking behaviors for those individuals. This internship has give me a clearer understanding of why patients’ oral health needs are unmet and urged me to dedicate my passion to help those who are less advantaged as a future dental practitioner.",

As aspiring women in medicine, we enjoyed the opportunity of expanding our understanding of contemporary medicine by conducting translational and clinical research, attending seminars and rounds in the Longwood Medical Area, and shadowing clinicians. Furthermore, in response to the dearth of women in academic medicine, we hosted weekly lunches with female physicians who contributed to our understanding of the importance of research, compassionate care, and education in the increasingly evidenced-based world of medicine. In studying rare diseases and their impacts on patients, we contributed to a crucial body of work that will improve therapies for diseases that affect populations worldwide, and we are excited to share all we have learned about academic medicine, clinical care, and the future of medicine.",

    "Final Abstract": "Primary cilia are hair-like projections of centrioles that extend from eukaryotic, mammalian cells. The diverse functions of primary cilia include sensory regulators as well as signal transducers in many signaling pathways, most notably in Sonic Hedgehog Pathway that promotes neurodevelopment (Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014). Mutations in eukaryotic cells that produce phenotypically altered primary cilia result in ciliopathies that give rise to various cognitive disorders, including Joubert's Syndrome and Meckel-Gruber’s Syndrome (Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014). However, there are many unknown genes in primary cilia that could be the cause of these syndromes. Genes encoding G-coupled protein receptors embedded in primary cilia play an important role in Shh pathway, specifically Gpr161(Mukhopadhyay and Rohatgi, 2014). Gpr161 is investigated in a gene knockout experiment in efforts to observe changes in cilia morphology using immunochemistry and electron microscopy that could give rise to cognitive disorders from causing disruption in the Shh pathway.  ",

I worked on one study examining the relationship between narcotics, congestive heart failure and readmission, and another looking at patient perceptions of physician attire. By working with my preceptor, I realized it is possible to practice medicine while still doing meaningful research. As an AMST and Chemistry double major, I worry that choosing one path means closing off the other. However, this summer I saw how my science courses allowed me to understand the mechanics while my humanities background made me an effective communicator. I learned that while not everyone will view your research as worthwhile having the ability to form a cohesive argument goes a long way. I hope that in viewing my presentation people will see the value of understanding the social, economic, racial, and gendered inequalities in our world no matter what field they choose. ",

    "Final Abstract": "If medicine belongs to the sciences and human rights to law, where does Physicians for Human Rights fit as an NGO? Existing somewhere between Doctors Without Borders and Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights’ program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones straddles this gap. They do so by identifying best practices in policing, medicine, and law during the course of investigations into sexual violence, and then increasing state accountability for meeting those standards. During this presentation, I will explore some of the methods used to identify those best practices and get states on board with enforcing them in East Africa, specifically in Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These tools include the unsurprising UN conventions, sensitivity training, to the unconventional…a cellphone app? I will consider these tools from the perspective of an intern who did everything from pack thermometers to write security protocols during her three months with PHR.",

Deciding what to do after you leave the safe enclaves of college often seems like an insurmountable task, yet everyone does it. This summer, I shadowed a neurologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and screened patients for studies focusing on rare neurological diseases.  In my spare time, I spoke with many Wellesley alumnae to hear how they traversed their career paths. Reflecting on insights from alumnae, in addition to experiencing clinical and research work in a hospital setting, helped me clarify my passion for medicine and personal career plans after graduation. ",

Scientists and doctors alike, however, are curious what makes the development of such a critical organ possible? For the past two summers, I interned in Dr. William Pu’s Lab at the Department of Cardiology at Boston Children’s Hospital, working alongside a postdoctoral researcher exploring mitochondria’s role in heart development. Through performing experiments, analyzing data, presenting research and shadowing doctors, I not only broadened lab skills but engaged firsthand with the many sides of translational and clinical research. I look forward to speaking more about my project, as well as about some important lessons I learned that before you can cure a heart disease, you have to better understand how a healthy heart forms, and that good research depends on a good question.",

Through our experiences in the pediatric emergency room, the P5 unit (gastrointestinal, transplant, and surgery patients), and The Zone (a therapeutic and educational play environment), we experienced another side of healthcare — a department closely attuned to the psychosocial needs of patients and not just the diagnosis and treatment of their illnesses. We worked with patients one-on-one in order to specifically address their educational, emotional, and social needs. Some of our most valuable experiences came from learning to soothe frightened and anxious patients with simple play therapy, witnessing the strong rapport between the Child Life specialists and the patients in their care, and sharing in parents’ relief that their child could experience joy in a hospital environment.",

    "Final Abstract": "Even though striosomes, a specialized subset of striatal neurons, were discovered almost four decades ago, their function remains largely unknown. I spent my summer in Dr. Ann Graybiel’s neuroscience lab at MIT, working to uncover more of this striosome mystery as it pertains to Huntington’s Disease using model mice. I trained these mice to perform behavioral tasks, managed a breeding colony to help establish lines of “birthdating” mice, and used embryonic time points to tag developing striosomes. I was able to use the collaborative skills from my Wellesley education to propose and defend ideas to a team of research scientists, and my experience solidified basic neuroscience research as a definite career path. This presentation will focus on how striosomes play a part in cost-benefit decision-making, and will propose potential connections between mood, motivation, and Huntington’s Disease.",

As a student who is deeply interested in the intersection of computer science and biological sciences, I spent the summer designing a library of 3’ untranslated regions--non-coding sequences within a gene that play a major role in regulating gene expression--in order to gain a better understanding of the quantitative effects of unknown regulatory elements in our genome. At my internship, I gained a newfound sense of confidence in conducting research independently and a deeper appreciation for computing power in biology. Moreover, this experience showed me how I could meaningfully merge the many interests I have developed thus far at Wellesley. I hope that those who attend will also be intrigued by the immense possibilities that result from bridging disciplines and understand the necessity of advocating for the materialization of your ideas in research.",

I spent much of my time in a primary health center commonly called “olomowewe,” which roughly translates to “child health center” in Yoruba. While olomowewe was unusual for most primary health centers in the country due to its affiliation with a major university, the reality of being in a resource-limited setting still greatly impacted the quality of care available. Despite this, many factors allowed the clinic to better manage the challenges of a lack of resources in ways I, as an outsider, did and did not expect. This experience further enhanced my desire for a career related to health care in resource limited settings.",

In particular, I wanted to learn more about the goal to provide equal access to free health care for all Danish citizens,  the hallmark of the Danish health care system. Through volunteer work in nursing homes both in Denmark and the United States, I have been able to compare how the values of each country are reflected in their respective health services. Through courses, field trips and out-of-classroom experiences, I have come to see our country's health care in a new perspective, which is undoubtedly valuable to my growth as a future contributor to the medical field.",

The program, called Food As Medicine, provides participants with fresh produce and cooking classes to increase access to healthy foods and influence the families’ eating habits.  As a part of this effort, I used my public health and economics background to research similar food intervention programs. My conversations with doctors, health activists, and government officials taught me that improving public health is complex, but Food As Medicine is a testament to how poverty-plagued communities can create innovative, sustainable solutions. ",

I worked as a field reporter for a statewide evening news broadcast, collecting audio and conducting interviews at community protests, meetings, and other newsworthy events in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though I worked closely with the directors of KPFA News, my work was mostly independent, as I was responsible for writing, voicing, and producing my own daily stories in a fast-paced, exciting newsroom.

This experience was significant because it allowed me to see real examples of privilege in education and its effect, such as not having professors that are familiar with the languages they are teaching, while in the US it’s a given. It proved to me that no person is inherently inferior, but rather is given different levels of opportunities and resources to succeed. This related to my experiences in Wellesley as it motivated me to pursue classes and extracurriculars that are related to social justice. I hope that people become aware of the impact of privilege in their own lives through this presentation.",

    "Final Abstract": "From Florida to Idaho, I have served and learned from several communities through the Alternative Break Program, a student-led initiative that organizes service trips during college breaks. This past summer, I participated in Break Away, a program that has confirmed for me the meaning and value of service and has empowered me to grow as a leader and as a student. A first-year service trip experience inspired me to pursue an Environmental Studies major. Service intersected with my academic pursuits again this past summer when I investigated how the Nez Perce tribe worked to preserve their native culture and practices in the face of social and environmental injustices that affect their reservation. Going to new places and learning about and serving alongside communities different from my own has been an integral part of my liberal arts education, and I hope to show attendees that they can often learn more from other people than they ever could on their own.",

Apart from organizing ethnographic interviews, entering native plant species in an online database, and working on the construction of a website for the project, I worked with other Chilean college students in the NGO CIEM Aconcagua, in the region of Valparaíso. Here, we carried out workshops at a nearby elementary school hoping to gain a clearer understanding of the way in which children develop their conceptions of the native environment. Through my work, I learned about the impact of mining in Chile. Living in Santiago, witnessing mass student protests, and speaking to other college students allowed me to learn more about Chilean politics and culture.",

We discussed the plight of refugees, the strain on European resources, and the politics of life and death. I had no idea the impact it would have on my worldview, and on my academic life. Through trips to refugee centers in Germany, community homes and aid stations in Denmark, and a land border crossing in Morocco, I witnessed firsthand aspects of the refugee experience. A conversation with a young woman who fled Syria deeply impacted me. I saw and spoke with the people behind the newsreels and political rhetoric. I saw the human cost of inaction. I am presenting today, not because I have all the answers, but because I want to share with you what I saw, and how it impacted me. I want the stories of those I’ve met to be heard.   ",

CMS was created to ensure that migratory animals can move across national borders and is a branch of the UN Environment Programme. This internship was a window into the workings of UNEP, which has the potential for global reach but can lapse into lumbering bureaucracy. I understand better how multinational treaties function in practice, and the pros and cons of working at an international organization in a foreign country. I spearheaded the communications for a meeting of the signatories to a CMS Agreement, including summarizing proposed policies and outlining their importance. I learned to organize a campaign, read policy, and write in a neutral but palatable way about political topics. I would like to share these discoveries in a Tanner presentation.",

In Dalian, China I lived with my Chinese grandmother and auntie in a host family set up. I took rigorous language courses at Dalian University of Technology, and I was able to build on my language skills in an immersion setting. While learning about the language and culture was a large part of my experience, I also fell ill for a month out of the two that I was in China. It was then that I learned of the differences in the health care systems in China and the US. My experiences in China have allowed me to hone in on future career choices in the medical field where I can integrate my gained knowledge of Chinese language and culture.  ",

Our cultural exchange began as being a summer councilor in New York City for middle and high school age Chinese students. Through the lessons we created and taught, as also through visiting cultural sites, we gave a snapshot of American culture to our Chinese students. After being councilors, we spent days with university Chinese students to understand the personal experiences of life through their eyes. Those days represented the coming together of our diverse cultures. The exchange was completed by our travel to Beijing where we stayed for two weeks. Without knowledge of the city or language, this time we were the ones receiving the snapshot of Chinese culture by receiving lessons and touring cultural sites. From teacher to student, New York to Beijing, and everything in between, this was our cultural exchange. ",

    "Final Abstract": "Much is said of people living in poverty, the inner city, abusive relationships, and of other marginalized backgrounds, but little of their experience is actually understood. Through interning at Renewal House, St. Francis House, and St. Stephen’s B-SAFE this past summer through the Lumpkin Summer Institute for Service Learning, we were afforded the opportunity to work directly with survivors of domestic violence, people experiencing homelessness or living in poverty, and low-income children from underserved schools in the Boston area. While each of these organizations has the larger mission of fighting oppression in these communities and beyond, it is the small, daily personal interactions with clients that make that goal a possibility. By working with these populations, we were challenged to reconsider traditional narratives about the experiences of marginalized people and to consider the role that systems of oppression play in shaping their potential.",

    "Final Abstract": "Why is it that people often vote against policies that are in their best interest? I spent my summer at the UC Berkeley Social Interaction laboratory, exploring how individuals perceive economic inequality in the United States, and what impact these perceptions have on social policy. Income inequality in the United States today is drastic, and the gap between the rich and the poor is larger than ever. Policy-makers are alarmed at the burgeoning inequity, and are increasingly turning toward behavioral economics to help address issues of inequality. This presentation will focus on how insights from behavioral economics help explain some seemingly odd decisions that people make when voting on economic policy. Drawing on my economics background, I will discuss how altering the way we think about and measure economic inequality will allow policymakers to change perceptions of inequality across party lines, and thus create more effective redistributive policies.",

In a typical day, I wrote briefings on Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings, conducted policy projects, conducted Capitol Hill tours, and responded to Illinoisans’ needs. This was my first internship in the federal government, where I aim to work after law school. I used the skills I learned at The Wellesley News and my economics and Russian area studies classes to analyze complex issues. In a historic presidential election year, I found the Senate’s political environment unique, fast-paced, and invigorating. This experience was crucial in my decision to pursue public service in the future.I hope my presentation can encourage more Wellesley students to intern for the federal government, show them the often latent virtues of public service, and show that political service truly has a home for all majors.",

When I first came to China, I had difficulty in communicating with the locals to interview them about their own experiences and opinions. There was also an issue of trust why would these locals trust me, a foreign stranger, with their opinions about the Chinese government and their thoughts on nuclear politics? Getting their trust and breaking through language barriers taught me a lot about conducting fieldwork in a foreign country, which is important for me, as a Political Science major. This experience nuanced the cultural and language barriers that I often read about in my textbooks. I hope that those who attend my presentation will learn how to overcome language barriers and connect with locals in a foreign country.",

This summer, I interned as an English teacher at Vincent Girls’ High School (VGHS) in the eastern town of Batticaloa to study the Sri Lankan education system and to also explore post-war development in the country. Much of what I learned about culture and development in Sri Lanka echoed themes of religion, family, and gender that I have studied in my South Asia Studies classes at Wellesley. Attendees of my presentation will learn more about the Sri Lankan education system and will also hear about identity and development in the nation after the end of the thirty-year civil war in 2009. ",

Through my unforgettable classes, experiences, and interactions with the Cuban people, I learned to view Cuba as a unique country with a complex identity. It is not only a beautiful Caribbean country with extremely amiable people, but also a country whose unique history and culture has had the power to strengthen the bonds while driving a divide among its people. The goal of this Tanner presentation is to share what I’ve learned to erode stereotypes of Cuba, and break the barrier between U.S. perception and Cuban reality.",

While contributing to a book RF commissioned our office to produce about RF’s disaster relief work, I encountered firsthand the webs of money and politics my coworkers navigated every day in their pursuit of change.  The experience helped me analyze my own understandings of activism and the development industry in South Asia, both as an anthropology student focused on critical development studies and as someone drawn to, yet ambivalent about, development work.",

It was so notable, in fact, that I found myself gushing to a friend about how everyone seemed to be blessed with great genetics. “Of course,” she explained, “Politics is a social profession...human instinct naturally draws us toward attractive people, those people who hone their social skills have an advantage in politics.” As it happens, the Capitol offers far more than lessons in the legislative process; it’s an opportune place to develop people skills, confidence, and grasp the nuances of American politics. My internship offered unparalleled networking opportunities and insight into the complex legislative machine.",

While abroad, I was able to fulfill my dream of trekking across Europe, during which I learned how to make connections in an unfamiliar environment, make the most of my experience while living on a tight budget and learn the impact that my gender had on my travels. I will examine the tradition of travel in Europe, focusing on transportation and the relationship between travel and gender.   ",

As a geosciences major and anthropology minor I am fascinated by how people learn about these events and prepare for them. I worked with the Dunedin City Council and researched natural hazard information and how cities decide to prepare for disasters. Everything changes in a second and the optimistic bias that convinces people that this just won’t happen to them prevents them from completing the small chores that could make a difference. I saw citizens appeal building codes to build their houses in tsunami and flood risk areas. A flood in Dunedin last June helped me compare a low socioeconomic community to the university’s preparedness. I discovered the importance demographics play in the receptivity and access to natural hazard information. I submitted my findings to Civil Defense and Emergency Management.",

As a farmhand, I was responsible for the physical daily care of the flocks, as well as the preparation of products leaving the business. It is very common to accept that food comes from farms without realizing the work that goes on beyond the storefront. Having been part of the sheep-milking and cheese-making process, I now have muscle memory of the labor put into farm animals and land, but also a deeper understanding of what it means to be “sustainable” and “farm-to-table.” As a biology major planning to work in the future with animals, this experience was vital to understanding today’s human-animal interactions. I think it’s important to learn that sometimes the most meaningful learning experiences occur outside the classroom and office, and that getting your hands dirty is a real aspect of the work field. ",

I also explored the various laws in India that specifically seemed to target members of the LGBT community. This internship allowed me to discover the circumstances of the LGBT community in India. Since the queer identity is such a taboo topic in Indian society, I was unaware of how bad the conditions could actually get for people of sexual minorities, even though I am an international student from India.

Familiarizing myself with the protocol of the CNDH—an independent organization mandated by the UN yet funded by the Moroccan government—and the current human rights work in Morocco revealed a need for a slower pace of bureaucracy than expected. While my Moroccan colleagues explained leaps forward in family law, they also readily answered questions about its spotty enactment. They touted the right to free speech and assembly for citizens, yet asked me to summarize reports from the Freedom House underscoring weak points in the freedom of Moroccans. Duality seemed to serve as a go-between between the new generation and the old, and the result was a textual history denoting the stability of the country through tense situations both in and out of its borders. ",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer I was an intern at a social policy and applied psychology lab and was mainly involved with a project focusing on analyzing the efficacy of home intervention programs. The most edifying experience I had was learning about ethical practices in the lab. A significant portion of my role at the lab involved consenting protocol and retention efforts, which both provided direct exposure to IRB regulations and internal decisions the lab had made about how to operate in a just manner. I am excited for students to learn about the differences between reading about ethical procedures in a classroom, as I’ve done at Wellesley, and applying those in a lab with human subjects, especially as rules are challenging and blurry. I was lucky to work in a lab that took this as an opportunity to be as morally and scientifically rigorous as possible. ",

    "Final Abstract": "A year ago, I doubt I would have ever heard the term “cleantech,” let alone known what it meant. All that changed, however, through an internship with the Cleantech Group, the owner of the term “cleantech” as a registered trademark and a leader within the cleantech industry. “Cleantech” refers to any technology that enables more efficient use of resources. Extending far beyond solar and wind companies, the cleantech industry also includes companies like Airbnb, the popular home-sharing service, because it increases efficient use of space and resources by reducing the number of hotels built. This summer taught me that business and technology can be a powerful force not only for innovation, but also for environmental impact, although that impact is more complicated than meets the eye. I look forward to sharing my excitement about this field with other Wellesley students and hope they consider cleantech as an avenue to engage their interests in business, technology, and the environment.",

I found that abstract mathematical work like concepts in convex optimization could be used in surprisingly many fields like finance, physics, and biology. It can help people choose portfolios in finance market, determine the trajectory of a landing rocket, detect essential genes of a cell, and recover a signal with noise. This learning experience makes me more interested in mathematical optimization and computer science. It turns the maths concepts I learned in the linear algebra class at Wellesley into a powerful tool for finding a mathematically provable optimal point. I hope people who attend my presentation will realize the power of this technique as I did and have a rough idea of how to express a real life problem in maths formulas and codes.",

    "Final Abstract": "On my summer internship with the University of Cincinnati Laboratory for Advanced Healthcare Technologies I worked with a team of Computer Engineers, Graphic artists, and ER doctors to design, implement, and test an IOS application that helps EMT’s to diagnose stroke. In addition to quantifying stroke severity, this innovative app uses geolocation to identify the most appropriate hospital for stroke treatment and facilitates Facetime communication with the treatment center. While I had a variety of experiences, ranging from learning 3-D human animation to App development in the Swift language, the most valuable experience was learning to work with a non-technical client. Beyond learning tactics for communicating across fields, the experience instilled in me a profound admiration of academic collaboration, and deeper understanding of what it means to be a diverse and effective team in an increasingly technical world.  ",

The SeedKit is a low-cost lab-in-a-box used to teach hands-on science experiments in low-resource schools. This summer, deployed the SeedKit in five schools in the suburbs of Accra, Ghana. We worked with a Boston-based NGO, The Exploratory which runs after school science club for girls programs in Ghana. By establishing relationships with students and science teachers, we immersed ourselves in a new culture and learned how we will further adapt the SeedKit to match their needs. Here on campus, we worked on developing assessments and data analysis strategies that could be used to determine the efficacy of our project. Through the decision making process we started to understand the importance of cultural sensitivity when designing projects for other communities. We will provide insight into the challenges we faced as social entrepreneurs in the education sector, and the things we learned from various mentors in the Ghanaian and Wellesley communities.",

    "Final Abstract": "Often, peering into our own past requires looking outward – very, very far outward. Spectral analysis of protoplanetary disks – the disks of cold gas and dust that form infant solar systems – provides a snapshot of the structure and chemical composition of the disks as they evolve in time. Analysis of these disks helps us to understand how our own Solar System may have formed, and what features of it may be common or anomalous in the solar systems of the universe. Drawing heavily on my Wellesley astrophysics coursework, I conducted research analyzing absorption spectra of four protoplanetary disks using data from the Keck II telescope. I am excited to have had the opportunity to investigate our own origins – through systems light-years away. ",

In particular, I focused on how to address math fear and anxiety and change students’ mindsets about math education.Math education is a huge issue today, especially in the area I worked in (math proficiency is only at 10% in Providence schools), but math anxiety and illiteracy is a problem for a significant number of American adults as well. Learning how to teach math to students that felt they could not learn it taught me how reframe the experience of how students learn math.I am a math major and plan on teaching math in the future, and this experience inspired me to keep learning for myself and my students.    Math is hard and scary for everyone, but everyone can push past that struggle to succeed at it.",

    "Final Abstract": "In Peru, a large performance gap between private and public schools has led to a false belief that all private schools are inherently superior to public schools. Consequently, government officials have neglected the education system over the years and let the private sector play a larger role. The ultimate goal during my internship at GRADE was to debunk this myth and argue for more government support of education. I assisted my supervisor in preparing papers for government leaders regarding the national education policy, and started an analysis of the education system. I was able to hone my research skills, learn more about the Peruvian education system, and practice my communication skills. This experience also reaffirmed my hopes to pursue policymaking as a career path.",

This past summer, I worked with INIDA and the University of Cape Verde on Santiago Island to examine how water is managed along with related development issues. By interacting directly with people in the city and countryside, I witnessed firsthand how different daily life is from that of developed countries. I observed conflicts and management decisions between communities, institutions, and governmental parties. Using design engineering principles, I delved deeper to find the root cause of clashes over water and technology, and I realized the increasing complexity in doing so. I was, thus, forced to change my perspective and approach. I now understand the impact of not only technology but also that of education and cultural norms.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer, I fulfilled my calling as an Idahoan by working for a potato company. I managed the social media accounts for the Innate® potato, a genetically modified potato developed by the J.R. Simplot Company. The Innate® potato was developed over the course of fifteen years to be bruising/browning resistant and to contain less acrylamide (a probable carcinogen) when fried at high temperatures. These traits allow for more sustainable potato production by reducing food waste. Many people believe that GMOs are bad, but aren’t sure why. As a result, the social media climate around GMOs is overwhelmingly negative, despite the scientific consensus that GM foods are safe. My presentation will explore the complicated nature of potato production and teach attendees about the consumer traits of Innate® potatoes, the prevalence of biotech crops in the food supply, and the strategies employed for successful social media management in a controversial industry.   ",

National volunteer teaching programs, like AmeriCorps’s Reading Corp or Teach for America are often critiqued for relying on the White Savior Complex to recruit teachers. Drawing on my experience with AmeriCorps in Minneapolis, I examine the validity of this criticism but also the various opportunities to improve tutors’ cultural competency. Specifically, I will present my research about Native American education in Minneapolis. Based on interviews with Native American educators, I created a resource guide for tutors not familiar with the community, which addresses the historical trauma that resulted from the US public education system being used as a tool of oppression.  My guide provides suggestions for culturally sensitive methodologies for volunteer teachers, and is an example of how volunteer teaching programs can be more inclusive.  ",

Firstly, we scraped aa.org to obtain the urls of the local chapter sites. Next, we are scraping each local site to obtain all the urls listed, however this is proving to be very difficult. While we are working on perfecting the scraping code, we are also working on finding the best classification algorithm for determining whether a particular page contains a list of meetings. We are currently comparing a variety of machine learning algorithms for this task. For those pages in which our code is not able to produce high accuracy we will use crowdsourcing.",

My research was on organic semiconducting materials, which can potentially be used in various medical devices. Yet my summer was not only science-focused it was a perfect liberal arts experience in which I was able to enjoy cultural immersion in a country that values beauty in people, food, art, nature, and life. This experience was unforgettable for the three Fs of my title, friends, food and fisica; a perfect fusion of my two passions that taught me how science and humanities are not opposites but fields that nurture one another and are equally necessary for developing the human mind and heart.  (I was unable to select Language/Literature as another tag for my presentation, which I would like to add.

I taught 7th grade science and art classes in the South Bronx, where I witnessed the effects of the achievement gap and the difficulties students faced when their families could not provide them with what they needed to succeed. This experience opened my eyes to see the increasing demand for academic and emotional support for students whose paths to college may be more challenging. I hope that my presentation will bring to light some of the struggles these students experience, while offering my peers a chance to reflect on their own journeys to Wellesley, and whether they bear marked similarities or differences to the obstacles that these middle school Bronx students face. ",

I worked in five different groups focusing on soft dollar accounts, cash equity research sales, hedge fund operations and clearing, structured cross asset sales, and prime brokerage sales and capital introduction services. Working at Goldman Sachs was an incredible opportunity to see how a major financial institution responds to worldwide events such as the Greece crisis, Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, the Olympics, terrorism in France, Brexit, and more. As a psychology major and a computer science minor entering Securities was daunting but I found that my two fields of study, though seemingly unrelated to finance, actually provided me with the diversity of thought that helped me succeed throughout my time. I hope that those who attend my presentation will understand more about the various opportunities at large banks and how to successfully pursue them. ",

    "Final Abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a popular way to learn, but they face high dropout. When users drop out, it is known as churning. The process of predicting churn in MOOCs can be applied to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Since it is more costly to obtain new customers in prepaid telecommunications services than to retain them, it is important to be able to pinpoint those who may churn. This research opportunity showed me how industrial research is done, specifically at Huawei Technologies, how to work with an international team, and serve as project manager. At Wellesley, there are many opportunities to engage in academic research, but it is difficult to find industry opportunities that focus on research, especially in international locations. I hope that my audience will learn that research is possible in industry, and the value of working with people from different cultures in international positions.",

    "Final Abstract": "In our panel, we'd like to focus on three different summer internships that investigate the ways in which computer science and education intersect. Eliza worked as a TA with Duke TIP, an academic summer program. She planned nightly computer science activities supplementing a Cryptography class and designed \"kinesthetic coding\" games to explain introductory programming concepts to the students. Margaret worked in Wellesley’s Human Computer Interaction lab on a project geared towards teaching children about synthetic biology through an interactive museum exhibit.Pet worked as a TA at the GirlsWhoCode summer immersion program, where she worked with her teaching team to lead lectures, labs, and projects in an attempt to introduce 20 teens to introductory CS concepts. She learned a lot about herself, her students, and the joys/woes of teaching during the course of 9 weeks.Daniela worked with Professor Sravana Reddy at Wellesley to make an automated grader for problem sets targeted for the introductory CS class at the college.All of these internships taught us about the prominent role that computer science play in all levels of education and the enhancement of knowledge.  They gave us insight into how our own educations have been improved, or could have been over the course of our lives.  We hope that our audience will leave thinking about engaging more with computer science as an effective tool that can shape learning.",

One of only six in America and seven in the world, FIRS gave me a very hands-on experience in the research used to bring murderers to justice. Despite the necessity for definite evidence in a murder case, the knowledge needed to accurately determine how long a body has been out is surprisingly low, especially in scenarios involving different conditions. FIRS, located near Grand Junction, Colorado, helps fill these gaps by researching how the human body decays in a desert environment. In helping collect data for multiple projects, I gained insight in osteology, crime scene processing, and unexpectedly, photography. Smelly, morbid, and completely amazing, my internship was invaluable in showing how much still needs to be done in the forensic field.",

I helped with different experiments and gained experience of many research processes, including brainstorming ideas, reviewing literature, collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data. In addition, I also designed my own study, examining whether people show an aversion to complexity, and, if so whether that could explain the fact that some high-return, low-risk strategies or securities do not have a high demand in financial markets. The experience expanded my knowledge and academic understanding of both psychology and economics, and helped to inform me about potential future career paths. I am eager to share my experience of conceiving a research question, designing experiments, and finding results. ",

GPCRs are implicated in a variety of physiological processes, from the transmission of sensory information to the regulation of blood sugar levels. As such, GPCRs are drug targets to approximately 30% of marketed pharmaceuticals today. Improved understanding of the secretin receptor's structure-function relationship is therefore crucial to generating and refining new treatment methods for a variety of human diseases.

In simple terms an LTI provider is a technology that allows one online learning platform to connect with and share information with another online learning platform. During my summer I worked to create a basic LTI provider that would allow us to share students’ grades from our platform to another major online learning platform like Moodle or Open EdX. When I was not doing development work I was researching distance and online education in Indonesia as well as meeting with local professional educators to discuss the market for online education in Indonesia.",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer, I participated in the Partnership Education Program in Woods Hole. Along with fourteen other students from across the country, I was introduced to the oceanographic and environmental sciences through coursework and research. Working in Dr. Amanda Spivak’s lab at the Oceanographic Institution, I researched salt marsh plant community response to restoration using percent cover, height, and biomass calculations. Overall, I learned more about what being a scientist would entail. Science is never quite as precise as I imagine, and data rarely comes out as expected. This is because our world and its beautiful ecosystems are extremely complex and variable. After this experience, I learned I love connecting field and lab work, and hope to further pursue these interests at Wellesley to apply them to a career. The greatest lesson I learned is every perceived roadblock is an opportunity to ask another question and pursue another branch of research.",

    "Final Abstract": "This past summer, the six of us were software engineering interns at various tech companies, ranging from tech giants to startups, scattered across the country. Even though we each worked to solve very different problems, the lessons we took away are similar and reflect our shared experience in the Wellesley Computer Science department. Through being part of a software development team, all of us came to realize that collaboration is essential, asking questions is a valuable skill, and that coding in industry is very different from working on a problem set. We will discuss noteworthy takeaways from our unique experiences which will clearly illustrate that tech companies can vary widely in the problems they solve, software engineering internships are extremely beneficial for learning, and how to land an exceedingly valuable, educational internship at a tech company.",

    "Final Abstract": "     I worked in an immunology lab at MD Anderson Cancer. I focused on an immunotherapy approach against multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer formed by malignant plasma cells found in the bone marrow, and specifically on how antitumor monoclonal antibodies could enhance cross-presentation of cellular antigens. I learned the basics of immunology and lab techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blots, ELISA assay, among others, that can be applied to any biology lab.     In my introductory biology course at Wellesley, we discussed translational research to enhance human health. This experience taught me the importance of lab research in finding solutions to cure cancer; for instance, several of the antibodies that were made in the lab were being tested in clinical trials for application on multiple myeloma patients. I hope my audience will learn about the potential immunology has in curing cancer and the significance of research on improving medicine. ",

    "Final Abstract": "As a Taiwanese-American student who grew up in American culture, I never really experienced what it was like to live within the local Taiwanese community. Thus, I leaped upon the opportunity to intern at the Taiwan branch of Tomofun, an international pet technology startup. Although I have lived in Taiwan ever since I was nine years old, I surprisingly went through a reverse culture shock. Spending the summer at home in Taiwan while interacting with the local Taiwanese employees in the company lead me to strengthen my bond with my Taiwanese roots, yet it also prompted my American roots to loosen. Through my time at Tomofun, not only did I obtain skills and experience in Sales and Operations, but I also gained a perspective on my cultural identity.  In this presentation, I will present on my experience working in an international startup and how it has changed my view of myself and Taiwan. ",

    "Final Abstract": "This summer I worked as a research intern for The Hamilton Project, a part of the Brookings Institution which creates public policies designed to make the domestic economy work better for more people. To do this, The Hamilton Project not only produces original research on important features of the economy, but also brings together experts to create empirically driven policy proposals. Some examples of topics I worked on are prisoner reentry, occupational licensing, Head Start, and life expectancy. Being part of the research team helped me to understand how my economics coursework flows into the economic policy. I also saw both the power and limitations of economic research for creating social change. In my presentation, I will discuss the workings of The Hamilton Project, the policy issues on which I worked, and the major takeaways I have from this experience. ",
